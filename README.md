This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

<!-- 
You can omit quotes when the key is a valid JavaScript identifier:

It doesn't start with a number,

It has no spaces or special characters,

It isn't a reserved keyword.

lightHover is a valid identifier, so you donâ€™t need quotes.

ðŸ”¹ Quoted keys ('auto')
You must use quotes if the key:

Is a reserved word (auto, default, class, etc.),

Starts with a number ('1fr', etc.),

Contains non-alphanumeric characters (like -, space, etc.).

'auto' is a reserved keyword in JS, so quoting it avoids conflicts or unexpected behavior.
